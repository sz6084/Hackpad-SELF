# Sammie's Chonkpad
A macropad I think might be somewhat chonky

### Inspiration

I wanted to create a macropad for the keys I lost when i moved from daily-driving a laptop to a PC. Specifically, keys like Rewind, Play/Pause, and Next. These keys were not part of my laptop's function key alternates-they were dedicated buttons which I missed since my current keyboard, a (surprisingly decent and fully-sized) membrane keyboard, only had function keys with no dedicated media buttons. This is definitely not something everyone agrees with (and I find binding my function keys would be too tedious, especially since my old laptop did not have these bound to function keys anyways). It has 16 switches (numpad functions too!), 1 rp2040, and no LEDs (I don't want the hassle and my membrane keyboard doesn't have it anyways, thought RGB in a future macropad would be cool). Something else I might consider is using Choc v2 switches but since the guide used Cherry MX switches I decided to do the same.


### Challenge

I had never designed a macropad before, let alone use Fusion360 or KiCAD at all. I followed the online guide (thanks @Cyao but please update it!) and consulted my trusty friend who had more experience than I did. I also asked questions in the Hack Club Slack.


### Specifications

BOM:
 - 16x Cherry MX switches
 - 1x XIAO RP2040
 - 16x Blank DSA keycaps
 - 4x M3x16 Bolt
 - 4x M3 Heatset

Others:
 - KMK firmware
 - TopCase.stl (as soon as I sort my files!)
 - Bottomcase.stl (as soon as I sort my files!)
